#
# Two failure modes motivate this. First, an interactive TUI (e.g. Claude Code)
# ingests a rapid bulk burst as a bracketed paste - the "[Pasted text #N]"
# placeholder - and an Enter fired in the same burst is absorbed as a newline
# inside that paste instead of submitting; the WM_SUBMIT_DELAY settle between the
# text and the Enter lets the paste finalize first. Second, during a freshly
# spawned session's startup the Enter can be swallowed by the startup transition
# even after the text lands, leaving the message unexecuted in the input box (a
# fixed delay cannot cover a variable startup). Submitting always consumes the
# input box and advances the pane, so the confirm loop compares the pane against
# its just-composed state and re-presses Enter until it advances (bounded by
# WM_SUBMIT_TRIES). Extra Enters against an already-submitted, empty prompt are
# inert, so the retry is safe for the already-reliable crew-say path too.
